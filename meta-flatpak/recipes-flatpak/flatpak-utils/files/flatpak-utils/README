flatpak-utils is a collection of extra utilities for Intel IoT RefKit.

Currently flatpak-utils contains two extra binaries for dealing with
'flatpak sessions'. A 'flatpak session' is an automatically started
login session which runs one or more flatpak applications from a single
flatpak provide/remote. Each such remote has a dedicated user associated
with it and the flatpak applications are run within the login session
of that dedicated user.

There is currently a single binary provided which can be run in three
different modes:

- systemd generator

  A systemd generator used to generate a systemd service for each
  configured flatpak session during system initialization.

- session daemon

  A daemon used to run within each flatpak session to start the
  flatpaks for that session.

- update daemon

  A daemon used to monitor remotes, pull in available updates,
  and restart any affected flatpak sessions.
